# SudokuIOS

## Description 
My project is a simple sudoku game. It is made in swift for IOS devices.

## Installation
To run the code you have to have access to swift compiler.
I highly recommend to use Xcode so you can easily see the simulation.

## Explanation of the code.
The code is divided in 3 groups.
1. Shared 
2. Managers
3. Views
    3.1 Main Views
    3.2 Sudoku Views
    
### Group shared.
The group is used to files that will be used by the whole project.
In this case there is only one file and that is the Coordinates.swift
