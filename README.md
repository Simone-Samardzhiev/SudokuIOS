# SudokuIOS

## Description 
My project is a simple sudoku game. It is made in swift for IOS devices.

## Installation
To run the code you have to have access to swift compiler.
I highly recommend to use Xcode so you can easily see the simulation.

## Explanation of the code
The code is divided in 3 groups.
1. Shared 
2. Managers
3. Views
    3.1 Main Views
    3.2 Sudoku Views
    
### Group shared
The group is used to files that will be used by the whole project.
In this case there is only one file and that is the Coordinates.swift

### Group Mangers
The group is used to create file that will be used by the whole project
that will manage some kind of resources. In this case we have the SudokuManager 
that manages the view of the app and the generation of the sudoku.

### Group views
The group is used to store each view of the app.

#### The sub group main views
It contains the views that will be first rendered as the main screen of the app.

#### The sub group sudoku 
It views contains the views that will be used to display the sudoku.
